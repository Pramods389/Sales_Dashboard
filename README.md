## Sales_Excel_Dashboard
I designed and developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize bike sales data with various information using the Europe Bike Sales dataset (Kaggle). The dashboard provides insights for sales, profit, and customer demographics through dynamic charts, and slicers.

## Business Requirements:
- What is the monthly trend of revenue?
- Which countries and regions contribute most to sales and profit?

- How do different age groups and genders influence sales?
- What is the most sold product category?

## Key Features:
- Data Cleaning & Preparation:
1. Formatted raw data into Excel tables.
2. Categorized customer segments by age.

- Pivot Tables & Charts:
1. Created Pivot Tables to summarize.
2. Revenue and Profit by Country.
3. Monthly Sales Trends.
4. Sales by Product Category.
5. Number of orders per product category.
6. Customer Segments (Age, Age Bracket)

- Interactive Slicers:
1. Enabled drill-down by Country, Product Category, Year, and Age Group.

- Visualization Techniques:
1. Line, Bar, Column, and Pie Charts for clear visual storytelling.
2. Clean layout with branded colors and formatting.

- Tools & Skills Used:
1. Microsoft Excel (Formulas, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers).
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation.
3. Data Visualization & Dashboard Design.

## Outcome:
